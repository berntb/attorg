Attorg
======

This open source project is an attempt to make a simple JavaScript implementation of a subset of Org Mode for Emacs.

The name comes from Atto Org.

From the choosen name, the obvious goal is less to replace Org Mode, more to have something usable from a generic web browser. At most, it is hoped this could become a gateway drug for Emacs... :-)

Notes
-----

Attorg is far from done and is a bit stalled, since it now really needs lots of love from someone with taste -- both in the UI and the UX department. I don't know any Emacs users with those skills.

Attorg use the Perl Dancer framework server side and on the client side jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

This upload is probably not really possible to clone -- it is done in a hurry, because I promised. I'll try to clean this up some of the coming weekends.

License
-------

The chosen license is GPL version 3, since it is about GNU Emacs.
